# Bubblesort-Time-Complexity-Analysis
Runs any size input N vector through bubble sort and returns the time it takes to sort the vector of size N. Based on the size N chosen it generates multiple random vectors for average time, sorted vectors for best time, and reverse order vectors for worst time. Each set of times is averaged and the results are output to a csv file.
